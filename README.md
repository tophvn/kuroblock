## Blocked Domains

The following domains are blocked to prevent the game from sending data to servers:

- **as-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for Asia region
- **eu-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for Europe region
- **us-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for North America region
- **hk-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for Hong Kong
- **jp-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for Japan
- **sea-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for Southeast Asia
- **tw-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for Taiwan
- **cn-datareceiver.aki-game.net** - Data receiver server for China
- **sentry.aki.kuro.com** - Error logging and reporting server (Sentry)

**Blocking purpose:**
- `datareceiver` domains receive data from game client (including cheat/mod information)
- `sentry` domain logs errors and sends reports to server
- Blocking these domains helps prevent servers from receiving information about unusual activities

## Backup Location

Backups are stored in: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\backups\`

## How it works

### Why block servers?
- When you use cheats in game, the game sends data to servers for verification
- Kuroblock blocks these domains by redirecting to `0.0.0.0` (no connection)
- Servers don't receive cheat reports ‚Üí minimizes risk of ban

### Why run once?
- Hosts file is a system file, changes are permanent
- Block entries persist until manually removed
- No need to run again on each boot

## Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only blocks reporting servers**, doesn't block local anti-cheat
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Some games have strong anti-cheat** (Vanguard, BattlEye) that can still detect
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use at your own risk** - Still possible to get banned if detected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No 100% guarantee** - Only minimizes detection risk
